# Community Calendar

A multi-organization calendar system for communities to share their calendars.

Individuals can also belong to calendars, including private ones if given permissions.

## Quick Start

git clone git@github.com:survos/calendar-bundle-demo.git
cd calendar-bundle-demo/
composer install
yarn install && yarn dev

bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load -n

#

symfony server:start -d

# OR php -S localhost:8300 -t public/
```
